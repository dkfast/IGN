To whom it may concern:

I have worked as a Developer/Graphic Designer for the past 5 years creating multiple projects using multiple forms of media. I have experience working with clients as well as very tight deadlines.

I graduated from Full Sail Real World Education in Winter Park, FL with my Bachelor of Science Degree in Digital Arts and Design in 2007. At Full Sail my hands-on training allowed me the opportunity to obtain a broad knowledge of industry standard applications including 3D and web. Full Sail is an accelerated school that moves very quickly. Projects were group and individual based with quick deadlines, which I met successfully with exceptional time management skills. I am creative as well as determined to get the job done with efficiency.

My current employer is Nielsen Media who specializes in TV ratings where I am challenged on a daily basis to complete projects in a timely manner while working with a creative team and making sure everything is acceptable to be delivered to the client. Some of my daily responsibilities include designing multiple interactive projects and then implementing them using flash, html, CSS, and Javascript, I truly feel like a 'Jack of all trades'. Additionally I am responsible for video editing, 3D design/modeling, and audio editing. I work on very highly visible projects that are seen from all over the world. 

Thank you for taking the time to look over my information and I appreciate your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you and I am very excited for an opportunity to work with your team.
